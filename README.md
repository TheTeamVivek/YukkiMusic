## 🙏 Special Thanks

A heartfelt thanks to [**Team Yukki**](https://github.com/TeamYukki) for creating the original [**YukkiMusicBot**](https://github.com/TeamYukki/YukkiMusicBot), which, although now inactive, served as the foundation for this project.  

A special thanks to [**Pranav-Saraswat**](https://github.com/Pranav-Saraswat) for forking and reviving it as [**YukkiMusicFork**](https://github.com/Pranav-Saraswat/YukkiMusicFork), making the bot functional again. However, **YukkiMusicFork** has since been deleted by Pranav.  

Our current project, [**YukkiMusic**](https://github.com/TheTeamVivek/YukkiMusic), is an imported and further improved version of the now-deleted **YukkiMusicFork**.
