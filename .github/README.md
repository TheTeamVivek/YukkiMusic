## 🎧 Setting Up YouTube Downloads

YukkiMusic supports multiple methods to handle **YouTube downloads**.  
You can use any **one** of the following approaches depending on your setup.

---

### 🍪 1. Using Local Cookies Files

If you have your own YouTube cookies files:

- Place one or more `.txt` files inside:  
```
internal/cookies/
```

- Each file should follow the format:  
```
internal/cookies/<filename>.txt
```

- The bot will automatically detect and randomly use a cookie file from this directory at runtime.

> 💡 You can store multiple cookie files to reduce rate-limiting.

---

### 🌐 2. Using a Batbin Link (`COOKIES_LINK`)

If you prefer to host your cookies online:

1. Go to [batbin.me](https://batbin.me).  
2. Paste your full cookies content there and save.  
3. Copy the resulting link (for example, `https://batbin.me/abcd1234`).  
4. Add it in your variables or in `.env` file like this:  
```
COOKIES_LINK=https://batbin.me/abcd1234
```

> ⚙️ The bot will automatically fetch and save the cookies from your Batbin link into the `internal/cookies/` folder during startup.

---

### ⚡ 3. Using [Fallen API](https://tgmusic.fallenapi.fun/)

The simplest and most reliable method for most users.  
The **Fallen API** handles YouTube extraction and downloading on the server side — no cookies required.

- Get your API key from [@FallenApiBot](https://t.me/FallenApiBot).  
- In your `.env` file:  
```
FALLEN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  
FALLEN_API_URL=https://tgmusic.fallenapi.fun
```

- If you don’t have a key, you can leave it empty.

> 💡 Recommended for users who don’t want to manage cookies manually.

---

### 🧩 4. Custom API or Advanced Integration

If you have your own API endpoint or downloader implementation,  
contact us at [@TheTeamVk](https://t.me/TheTeamVk) —  
we’ll provide ready-to-use **code templates** that you can integrate directly for your setup.

---
> ✅ **Summary:**  
> - Use **Fallen API** for the easiest setup (**paid**).  
> - Use **cookies** if you don’t want to pay for an API.  
> - Or contact us for a **custom solution** if you want to use your own API.
---

## 🧱 Platform System

YukkiMusic is powered by a **modular Platform System** — a flexible framework that allows it to fetch and download music from multiple sources like **YouTube**, **Telegram**, and more.  

Each platform works independently but connects seamlessly through a **priority-based registry**, ensuring the bot always picks the most efficient source for every query. ⚙️  

📖 **Learn More:**  
➡️ [📘 YukkiMusic Platform System](../internal/platforms/README.md)

> 💡 The Platform System is perfect for developers who want to add **custom APIs, new music sources, or modify fetching logic** without touching the bot’s core.
